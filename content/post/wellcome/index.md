Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I am population genetics researcher specialized on the application of Machine Learning techniques on the study of the demographic histry of human populations.

With a formal background in Genetics, specifically in Population Genetics and Molecular Anthropology, I recently completed my PhD at the Institut de Biologia Evolutiva in Barcelona, under Doctors Oscar Lao and David Comas on the definition of a demographic model for the North African populations. The project was centered on the application of Approximate Bayesian Computation with Deep Learning and Genetic Programming techniques to disentangle the demographic events that led to the current genetic diversity observed in North Africa.

My research provides me with a strong foundation in population genetics, data analysis as well as the use of many bioinformatic tools. On top of that, my line of work during my PhD thesis gives me experience on the use of demogenomic tools. 

In this portfolio you are going to find everything related to my advances as a scientist with special focus to the activities related to the [CSIC Momentum] (https://momentum.csic.es/) programme. 

If you want to contact me to discuss anything related to population genomics and the integretaion of AI in the study of demogenomics click the link to any of my socials below.
