Learning how to build my own digital portfolio has been quite the journey. For starters, the idea of what a digital portfolio is felt far from me. Like you don't often think of a researcher's portfolio, usually when you think about a portfolio your head goes to arts & craft, so getting in my head the idea of a what to put and how to putted so I doesn't feel like a glorified CV was extrange (it still feels odd but I think I am getting the hang on it). 

Once I more or less had the idea of what I was going to put in, or the use I am going to give it we fell into the second problem, which is how I am going to actually build it. First I wanted to try using one of the platforms we learned in class, but some have confusing perscostumization tools and others have very limited free options. After wandering around Wordpress and Wix a couple days I ended up discarding that option and decided to try Notion to build it. I was way more familiar to notion than to any of those platforms as I use it like a journal  in my 9 to 5, so building some sort of presentable page was easier. I completed a first draft fairly quick (https://jose-serradell.notion.site/jose-m-serradell?pvs=4) but it felt empty, boring. If those platforms present a limit number of customization options, Notion was worse. You basically couldn't do anything, so I ended up also discarding that option eventhough I was nearly done with it. Finally, I decided to code my way into the porfolio, but I don't have any knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript. The solution I ended up taking was to use a github template and more or less work from there. In this templates, the basic structure of the web page is already built in so my need of front-end knowledge was skipped but had enough room to customize each part of the portfolio as I want so it still feels mine. Once I settle on a template that I liked, it was time to start watching youtube videos on how to modify it to put the things I wanted and start to code up the page.

The end result, I can say it is satsifactory. Still a long way to the final product but I will keep improving it when I have time in the following months with the idea of learning some HTML and CSS so I kind improve the page. As I said, it has been quite the journey for a 5 hour course, but an enjoyable one. Having a headquarter of everything I have done professionally is a great way of keeping everything tidy which sometimes it's difficult mainly when you have 3 or 4 projects at the same time. The next step is the most difficult one keeping the portfolio updated, but las ganas are there.
